## Project Proposal
- A library that allows you to use multiple different computer vision models to solve a task at different image resolution levels (specially good for cancerous cell detection and with ophtalmological applications)
- A tool to analyze real estate data by region in the US leveraging public census data. 
- A tool to use GPS data to recognize patches of land on the Amazon and the Venezuelan Savannah that are being deforested and monitor the rate of deforestation.
