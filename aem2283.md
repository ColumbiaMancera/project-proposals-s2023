## Project Proposal
- A library that allows you to use multiple different computer vision models to solve a task at different image resolution levels (specially good for cancerous cell detection and with ophtalmological applications)
- A tool to analyze real estate data by region in the US leveraging public census data. 
- A tool to use GPS data to recognize patches of land on the Amazon and the Venezuelan Savannah that are being deforested and monitor the rate of deforestation. 

## Project Contributions
I'd start with smaller contributions to tensorflow such as those found in their "good first issue" (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/labels/good%20first%20issue) and "contributions welcome" (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/labels/stat%3Acontributions%20welcome) sections. Then, I'd move to tackle the addition of a new feature for computer vision applications. I realize this is very broad but I'm deciding on it, last semester I worked on multi-scale models for computer vision and that could be a solid addition to their repo.
