## Project Proposal
I personally follow the Intelligent Systems track so I thought it a good ide    a to participate in the maintenance of an ML platform/library such as tensor    flow.

## Project Contributions
As explained in class, I'd start with smaller contributions such as those fo    und in their good first issue (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/labe    ls/good%20first%20issue) and contributions welcome (https://github.com/tenso    rflow/tensorflow/labels/stat%3Acontributions%20welcome) sections. Then, I'd     move to tackle the addition of a new feature for computer vision application    s. I realize this is very broad but I'm deciding on it, although last semest    er I worked on multi-scale models for computer vision and that could be a so    lid addition to their repo (since they don't have anything of the like).
